# `boardemu`

This program emulates the computer vision component of [ChessEye](https://github.com/chesseye/chesseye).

It starts a GUI with a chessboard that you can edit at will, and produces a stream of sensor output that a perfect camera would have produced for the given position.

## Running

You need [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). (E.g. `npm install -g electron`.)

Run `electron .`.
